            <h1>Network Infrastructure In Wellington</h1>
            <p>Network infrastructures runs  all throughout  Wellington. To the human eye there are some we can easily identify and recognise but not physically see, this could include things like the internet.But there are physical elements to these things that we normally don't associate with having a physical form.An example of this includes underground cables that connect to wifi routers that provide wireless internet. Like this example, there are physical networks that we can see that we may not notice around Wellington, below there are three differing networks within Wellington that I found.</p>

        <h3>UberEats</h3>
        <p>The Network of UberEats in Wellington is a growing Network and company that are adding more restaurants and customers by the day. This network covers the food  delivery service and its connectivity throughout Wellington and its journey from the downloading of the  app to ordering and receiving of  your food.We also  look at the statistical information and data that Uber gets and stores as well as looking at the idea of the networks range expanding as far as the customer is willing to pay. <a href="ubereats.html" style="color:hotpink">.....Read More</a></p>

        <h3>Wellingtons Water</h3>
        <p>The Network of wellingtons Water in Wellington is an extremely fascinating topic.With a City that is predominantly hills the collection of Rainwater and the infrastructure set up to collect and stop flooding is a feat of modern day technology.This is a  prime example of how a massive network that not only works in  reducing flooding and providing water to the population but also does it in such a way that doesnâ€™t interfere with our daily life is an interesting. <a href="waterworks.html" style="color:hotpink">.....Read More</a></p>

        <h3>Phone booths</h3>
        <p>The network of PhoneBooths is a great example of a network that incorporates the idea that in the future these physical networks will get less and less obvious.What I mean by this is free wireless internet attached to these phonebooths.Most of the phone booths in the city area have wireless routers on the top of them.What is interesting is that people connect to those everyday but might not know where its coming from ,but just looking at their networks. <a href="phonebooths.html" style="color:hotpink">.....Read More</a></p>
