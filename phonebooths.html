            <h1>Phone Booth </h1>
            <p>The network of PhoneBooths is a great example of a network that incorporates the original idea of a network.Getting information frorm point A to Point B.But in todays day and age these physical networks will get less and less obvious.The computers get smaller,phones got smaller then now bigger.What I mean by this is that things like free wireless internet attached to these phonebooths.Most of the phone booths in the city area have wireless routers on the top of them.What is interesting is that people connect to those everyday but might not know where its coming from ,but just looking at their networks.</p>

        <h3>Spark To The Rescue</h3>
        <p>The History of phone booths are iconic.Even to this day there are 2,500 around New Zealand.What is interesting about these is that nobody wants them.No company wants to run these phone booths and neither does the council.In 2017 Spark telecommunications released that they are losing money on the phone booths.But the CEO was quoted saying "payphones are declining, but they still provide an important public service for those who need them, including emergency access to 111".In a world where the amount of cell phones are up in the billions do we still need phone booths?But Spark had made an impressive move by adding wireless internet to the booths.This comes in very handy for people who are with spark.More information on Sparks CEO on the topic.<a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/96618231/are-the-days-of-the-payphone-numbered" style="color:hotpink" target="_blank">More Information</a></p>

        <h3>Wireless Free Internet</h3>
        <p>The internet is a wonderful place.But in todays age there are so many ways to get screwed over by it.With Wifi there are always dangers especially joining a public one.When free wifi starting coming out years ago.There was no worries to join .But as we know there are many dangers of losing personal information which could include emails,personal info or even bank details.What is interesting was the way these wireless free internet are attached to these phone booths in town areas.By adding wifi onto these boxes and seeing the words "Free"and Wifi Sets up some risk for people to get baited.I believe that there should be more security measures to ensure people are convince its a safe wifi connection rather than just looking at the name.Here are  <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/home-apps-never-want-to-leave-house_n_6432220?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvLm56Lw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAeEktrqfIezHnqEPK3Pu03tRrtPT81miX35W584FK3BEjTn5ityRSt5ov8ArtmixVHK3KXzA7v5KRbV-ux8D_jnnD2_WcNUSrCZqGS43eVhPKN1hkmNYwJOUjLcAIdplT0snJu9MwusqQeG5gv_eERXW_spSXq9NMtTpoylU5Em" style="color:hotpink" target="_blank">More Information</a></p>

        <h3>Dial A Poem</h3>
        <p>On a weird but relevant tangent it was found that across my research for phone booths that I found an interesting concept that covers the idea that you pay a very small amount of money and you dial a poem at a place in  The Paseo festival in Taos.You listen to a random poem or versus and you listen to international poems connecting you through to knowledge.This conecpt of Dial A Poem is a very interesing concept and how just like networking it has the power to get knowledge across from one place to another.  <a href="http://www.telepoembooth.com/" style="color:hotpink" target="_blank">Top Predicted Foods 2019</a></p>
