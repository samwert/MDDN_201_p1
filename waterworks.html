            <h1>Wellington Water</h1>
            <p>The Network of wellingtons Water in Wellington is an extremely fascinating topic.With a City that is predominantly hills the collection of Rainwater and the infrastructure set up to collect and stop flooding is a feat of modern day technology.This is a  prime example of how a massive network that not only works in  reducing flooding and providing water to the population but also does it in such a way that doesnâ€™t interfere with our daily life is an interesting.</p>

        <h3>Storm Water</h3>
        <p>The stormwater system is a very interesting and complicated network of pipes.These pipes drain rain off roads,footpaths through gutters all around the place.These clean the water a tad but then goes into out streams,rivers and eventually out to the sea.Unlike wasterwater,which gets treated in a plant,stormwater does not get treated due to it ending back out in the sea.Even though these systems are set up to a high standard debris and pollution really does take a toll on these systems so its highly stressed by the council of Wellington to try and not litter.You can find out more about storm water maps from here. <a href="https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/stormwater/" style="color:hotpink" target="_blank">More Information</a></p>

        <h3>Wasterwater</h3>
        <p>Wasterwater is classified as the water that we use everyday in and outside the house.But majority of the water we use in our home comes from the inside.Specifically the bathroom with sinks and such,kitchen with taps,as well as laundry to do the washing.Once this water leaves your house and goes through the intricite pipes and networks it ends up going through to the treatment plants to get cleaned.This inturn gets put back into our rivers and streams then heading out to sea.It was clear from the Maori culture that the contamination of water was considered a very big thing to aviod.So the council works very closely with the local Iwi's.<a href="https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/wastewater/what-is-wastewater/" style="color:hotpink" target="_blank">More Information</a></p>

        <h3>Drinking Water</h3>
        <p>In the Wellington region the drinking water comes from three sources.This includes the Hutt River/Te Awakairangi ,the combinded river flow of the Wainuiomata and Orongorong rivers and "Waiwhetu Aquifer - a natural underground reservoir beneath the Hutt Valley that is fed by river-water seeping down into the ground".The water gets to our taps through an extremely complicated system of pipes and tunnels.They firstly go to reserviors all over wellington.Then gets pumped to local water distribution networks.Then goes through truck mains which are just a ways for the water to get to smaller pipes ccall reticulation mains which are in suburb areas.For a lot more information visit this page <a href="https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/drinking-water/where-does-it-come-from/"

        <h3>Emergency Water</h3>
        <p>Emergency water in Wellington is a must.What isn't advertised a lot is that the Wellingtons water supply network is extremely vulnerable.After a moderate earthquake it is most likely majority of the pipes and networks will need repairing.So the idea of storing your own emergency water at home incase is very reccomended.These systems are all dependant on each other if one part is damaged the whole system collapses.Like a network this is very a very applicable quality.If you want to see how to go about to preparing for an earthquake especially for water<a href="https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/emergency-water/" style="color:hotpink" target="_blank">Emergency Help</a></p>
